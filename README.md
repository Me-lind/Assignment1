Android Sales Automation App

This project aims to develop an Android application to automate sales in a small shop. The application will allow users to easily select items, manage quantities, and calculate discounts.

Features

Hardcoded Item Prices: Item prices are conveniently stored and managed within the application's source code, eliminating the need for manual data entry.

Quantity Selection: Users can effortlessly determine the quantity of each item purchased by clicking the corresponding item button. A maximum of 4 items can be purchased for any single item to prevent overselling.

Dynamic Discount Calculation: A 15% discount is automatically applied to the Grand Total if it exceeds 10,000. For Grand Totals less than or equal to 10,000, a clear toast message informs the user that no discount is applicable.
